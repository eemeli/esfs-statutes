ESFS Statutes
=============

The Statutes of the European SF Society, including a reconstructed history and proposed changes. The historical versions have been reconstructed as commit changes based on [archive.org snapshots](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.esfs.info/esfs-statutes.html) and reformatted in Markdown format.

This version of the statutes is not normative; that you'll find here: http://esfs.info/esfs-statutes/
