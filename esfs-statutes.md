# Statutes of the European Science Fiction Society


1.  The European Science Fiction Society (ESFS) was founded in 1972, at the first European Science Fiction Convention in Trieste.

2.  The Goals of the Society are: to find ways and means of establishing contacts between the Sf professionals and fans; to ensure better mutual knowledge of SF literature and arts and of fandom activity in the European countries; to propose the cognition of European SF in the rest of the world.

3.  Its registered office shall be for the time being at Editrice Nord, Via Rubens 25, 20148 Milano, Italy. It may be transferred elsewhere by a decision of the European Committee.

4.  To join the society it shall suffice to subscribe to this Constitution and to inform the National Delegate who will notify the ESFS Secretary, or to notify the ESFS Secretary directly. For special services rendered to European SF the Committee may award the title of ESFS Honorary Member.

5.  Cessation of membership may only be by resignation. No member of the Society may be excluded on racial, political or religious grounds.

6.  The Society resources shall include: - dues - grants and gifts received.

7.  The Society shall organize a European Science Fiction Convention (Eurocon) within the territory of a European country (see appendix 1) at least every two years. On the proposal of a National Delegate, or any reliable individual or organization, European Science Fiction Conferences (Euroconferences) may be organized, though not in the same period as the Eurocon. Euroconference votes may take place by email.

    The vote for the Eurocon shall comprise delegate votes, two for each country, and ESFS member votes on a one person-one vote basis. The vote shall take place by secret ballot, and the voting papers for delegates and members shall be differently coloured. Votes shall be counted in aggregate, but the winner shall attain at least a threshold of 35% of the votes cast by both members and delegates. In the event of the candidate with the most votes failing to reach this threshold, but coming within 5% of it, another vote may be held at least 30 minutes later between the two highest contenders. If a second vote fails to reach this threshold, or a second vote does not take place, the decision must be postponed to the next Eurocon, or to an extraordinary General Meeting.

    Eurocon campaign materials may include leaflets, posters, fanzines, badges, stickers, minor decorative display items and other informative material on the prospective convention and the host country, but a 'no treating' rule must be observed. In effect this means no bid parties.

    Any bid committee breaking this rule may have its candidature disqualified by a secret ballot of the delegates at the General Meeting. A disqualification vote may be proposed by any one delegate, and disqualification shall occur if 35% or more of the delegates approve it.

8.  The supreme body of the Society is the General Meeting, convened during the Eurocon. At the request of one third of the Society membership or of two thirds of its committee members, the Chair shall convene the extraordinary General Meeting.

9.  The General Meeting is attended by all ESFS members present at the Eurocon (but up to three votes are allowed for each country) and has the following prerogatives:

    a) to assess the activity of the Committee, on the basis of a report submitted by the Chair or by the elected Vice-Chair;  
    b) to elect the committee Officers;  
    c) to decide the places and dates of the Eurocons and Euroconferences;  
    d) to discuss and decide on other matters related to the Society's activity.

    Observers may attend and speak, they may also take part in the Eurocon and Euroconference votes, and in general advisory votes.
